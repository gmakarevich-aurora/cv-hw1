    # ===== Problem 2e =====
    # Without using a loop, multiply each row of M element-wise by a.
    # Hint: The function repmat() may come in handy.

    # ===== Problem 2f =====
    # Without using a loop, sort all of the values 
    # of M in increasing order and plot them.
    # Note we want you to use newM from e.
